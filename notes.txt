Install stack. Later instructions assume you're using the 64-bit version. 
Open a shell and run stack setup. This will download and install ghc and msys2, which may take several minutes.
Run stack exec -- pacman -Syu to update msys2. You'll need to press Y to confirm.
Run stack exec -- pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 to install the pkg-config tool and the SDL2 library.
Again, press Y to confirm.

- WorldShips are bimaps of objectids and coordinates
- WorldObjects are map of objectids and objects
- WorldSpriteParts is one bimap of coordinates and objectids
- newtype Auto a b = Auto (a -> (b, Auto a b))
- yampa (AFRP)
- Data.IxSet
- "Mark Miller showed that, with some tweaks, you can construct a *capability-safe* object system
   if you prevent objects from being globally accessible."

- Revisit parallax stars
- Revisit world layer / camera zoom
- Revisit camera pinning & camera bounding

- Star amount proportional to the screen surface area
- Walls that connects together with angles
- Change WorldLayer to WorldLayers (maybe use a Map?)
- Saving and reloading the game state

- Multiplayer
- Docking layers merges the layers. Detaching from a ship recreates a new layer.
- Kessler effect; to avoid saves growing exponentially with all the asteroids and stuff,
  algorithmically generate a layer and apply "patches" of the transformations done.
- Logistic system
- Pipe system
- Electric system
- Oxygen system
- Heat system
- Humidity system
- Hunger / hydroponics
- Singularity electric generator
- Give layers velocity and mass (amount of blocks).
- Collision detection; upon collision transfer of energy; if tiles too fragile, break
- Solar panels
- Air locks (pressure?)
- Air/heat leaks
- Lighting
- Stardust, nebula, glares and whatnot in the background
