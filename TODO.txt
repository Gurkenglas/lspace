- Revisit parallax stars

- Change WorldLayer to WorldLayers (maybe use a Map?)
- Saving and reloading the game state
- Multiplayer
- Docking layers merges the layers. Detaching from a ship recreates a new layer.
- Kessler effect; to avoid saves growing exponentially with all the asteroids and stuff,
  algorithmically generate a layer and apply "patches" of the transformations done.
- Building more stuff than boxes
- Logistic system
- Pipe system
- Electric system
- Oxygen system
- Heat system
- Humidity system
- Hunger / hydroponics
- Singularity electric generator
- Give layers velocity and mass (amount of blocks).
- Collision detection; upon collision transfer of energy; if tiles too fragile, break
- Solar panels
- Air locks (pressure?)
- Air/heat leaks
- Lighting
- Center camera on player on boot
