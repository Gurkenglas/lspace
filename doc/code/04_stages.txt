The game flow is divided into multiple stages.

The first stage is the game menu, then is the game itself,
then a gameover screen and the last one to save your progression.

The engine is responsible to call critical functions on whatever is
set to be the current stage. Therefore, you can easily switch to any
stage and whenever you want to.

* When switching stages, you will not lose their states. This is
because they are created at the begining of main() and destoyed
only at the very end. This is intentional.
