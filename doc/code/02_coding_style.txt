Ident style:
    - We use the K & R ident style with the 1TBS variant. You can easily
    find documentation on internet or browse trough the sources to
    understand what it means.

Object guidelines:
    - We use objects and some OOP concepts.
    - You will manage your objects yourself using malloc() and free().
    - You will never forget to call *_init() and *_fini() on objects.
    - You will never initialize or finalize -twice- the same objects.
    - You will never transfer ownership of your objects to something.

Pointer guidelines:
    - As so as you make a pointer available to the world, you must
    ensure that it will be used correctly by putting the right
    restrictions in place.

Callback guidelines:
    - Any parts of the game must be able to call your callback,
    whenever it wants. If there's nothing to be done, point it to a
    noop dummy function. Never set a callback to NULL.

Logic vs. rendering:
    - It might be very temptating to mix the game's logic with some
    direct rendering at times. I cannot predict how long we will be
    using ncurses and if we need to switch to another rendering
    method, we NEED to be able to do so. Please avoid mixing both.
