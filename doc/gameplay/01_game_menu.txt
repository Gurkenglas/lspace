The menu is the first thing you should see when you launch the game.

The available options are: create a new game, continue one already in
progress, change your settings or to quit.

You can navigate the menu using the arrow keys on your keyboard or
h,j,k,l if you are used to vim keybindings.

Finally, to select your option, hit Enter (return).
