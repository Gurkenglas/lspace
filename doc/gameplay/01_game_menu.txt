[Regulars]

    The menu is the first thing you should see when you launch the game.

    The available options are: create a new game, continue one already in
    progress, change your settings or to quit.

    You can navigate the menu using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

    Finally, to select your option, hit Enter (return).

[Intermediate]

    You can also navigate using the h,j,k,l if you are used to vim
    keybindings.

[Power-users]

    Most options will have a letter in bold. Pressing the letter once will
    move to that option. Pressing the same letter twice will simulate a
    press on the Enter key (therefore, chosing that option). Of course,
    you can always chose to hit Enter yourself.
