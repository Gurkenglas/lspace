The code base is divided into various folders:
    - build   : Ignored directory to let you compile and test stuff.
    - src     : The source files for the code.
    - include : The header files for the code.
    - lib     : For third-party libraries.
    - doc     : Documentation for the code but also the game.

Then there's some files at the root:
    - A license file (LICENSE.txt),
    - A readme file (README.md),
    - A project generation script for CMake (CMakeLists.txt).

An hidden .gitignore to help maintain the repositoy.
An hidden .gitmodules to help manage external libraries.
