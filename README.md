Lonesome Space
==============

Okay, so the project is still very young.

We have great destructive plans for what's to come over the next weeks.
We invite you to stay tuned, and if you want to contribute to the project, well, we don't accept any money.
You can, instead, send a pull request on Github though. ;)

    - Generate a project file using the CMake tool for your favorite IDE.
    - Compile the whole thing.
