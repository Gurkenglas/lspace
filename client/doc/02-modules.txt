List of the modules and their purposes:

main
    
    Currently is the owner of the game's main loop.

renderer

    Renders the visible chunks of the world by the player.
    
camera

    Can be moved around in the world. It's besically the world
    coordinates of the top-left corner of your screen.

coord

    Abstrating the world complex positioning system into just
    one object and offer simple operations on it.

size

    Defines and typedefs. It let us change the size of anything
    in the game more easily.

world > chunk > cell > layer > tile > gfx
    
    The world contains everything and is infinite in every directions.

    Because of that, it's been divided into chunks. the client and
    server can load and unload them as necessary.

    Each chunk contains cells.
    
    A cell is the smallest unit of position in the game.
    A cell has multiple layers (e.g. LAYER_GROUND, LAYER_ENTITIES, ...).
    
    Each layers can hold only one tile (e.g. TILE_GENERATOR_NUCLEAR).
    
    A tile can be animated so we have the gfx module to handle that.
