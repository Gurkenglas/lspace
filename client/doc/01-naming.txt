I have a very strange way of naming things and you need to get used to it.

The C language doesn't have namespaces, therefore, you have to prefix your
identifiers with something to group them.

I pushed the idea a bit further, love or hate.

(1)
    A classic example would be TILE_GENERATOR_NUCLEAR. It seems awkward at first,
    but the goal is, again, to group things.

    So all tiles begins with the word tile, then you have subgroups, here it's the
    generators, and lastly, what kind of generator it is.

    Instead of the common writing in english: nuclear generator.

(2)
    Another example is camera_coord_get().

    It's the camera module; you are dealing with its coordinates, and the action
    performed is a get.

(3)
    The most complex example I'm aware of is inside the coordinate system:
    
        world_position_chunk_x
                and
        chunk_position_cell_x

    We are talking about something in the world, actually its the position of something,
    oh it's a chunk, the value x.

    So we have the x value of a chunk positioned in our world.

    That's important, because as you can see just below, there's also the x value of a
    cell positioned in a chunk.

    And they arn't the same. Anyway, maybe I'll just refactor this module some day.


You get the gist of it.
