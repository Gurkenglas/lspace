== Vector Math ==

A vector can have many meanings, depending on whether we are talking geometrically or numerically.
In either case, vectors have dimensionality; this represents the number of dimensions that the vector has.
A two-dimensional vector is restricted to a single plane, while a three-dimensional vector can point in any physical space.
Vectors can have higher dimensions, but generally we only deal with dimensions between 2 and 4.

Technically, a vector can have a single dimension. Such a vector is called a scalar.

In terms of geometry, a vector can represent one of two concepts: a position or a direction within a particular space.
A vector position represents a specific location in space. For example, on this graph, we have a vector position A:

(Figure 1)
               |
               |
               |
               |    x (A)
               |
               |
---------------|---------------
               |
               |        x (B)
               |
               |
         x (C) |
               |

A vector can also represent a direction.
Direction vectors do not have an origin; they simply specify a direction in space.
These are all direction vectors, but the vectors A and C are the same, even though they are drawn in different locations:

(Figure 2)
               |       ^
               |      /
               |     / (A)
               |    x
               |
               |
---------------|---------------
               |
           ^   |        x (B)
          /    |         \
         / (C) |          v
        x      |
               |

That's all well and good for geometry, but vectors can also be described numerically.
A vector in this case is a sequence of numbers, one for each dimension.
So a two-dimensional vector has two numbers; a three-dimensional vector has three. And so forth.
Scalars, numerically speaking, are just a single number.

Each of the numbers within a vector is called a component.
Each component usually has a name.
For our purposes, the first component of a vector is the X component.
The second component is the Y component, the third is the Z, and if there is a fourth, it is called W.

When writing vectors in text, they are written with parenthesis.
So a 3D vector could be (0, 2, 4); the X component is 0, the Y component is 2, and the Z component is 4.

When writing them as part of an equation, they are written as follows:

(Figure 3)

->   | x |
a  = | y |
     | z |

In math equations, vector variables are either in boldface or written with an arrow over them.

When drawing vectors graphically, one makes a distinction between position vectors and direction vectors.
However, numerically there is no difference between the two.
The only difference is in how you use them, not how you represent them with numbers.
So you could consider a position a direction and then apply some vector operation to them, and then consider the result a position again.

Though vectors have individual numerical components, a vector as a whole can have a number of mathematical operations applied to them.
We will show a few of them, with both their geometric and numerical representations.
